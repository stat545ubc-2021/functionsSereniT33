## Load pacakges & Choose dataset

We will first load the required packages. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)
library(datateachr)
```
I will take a look at the data set, "flow_sample," before creating a function. 

```{r}
glimpse(flow_sample)
```

## Exercise 1 & 2. Make & Document Functions 


Wrapper
```{r}
#' This function is a wrapper for the following delta function [annual_flow_gap] below. The purpose
#' of this wrapper is to pivot the existing tibble into a simpler form, containing
#' year, maximum flow values, and minimum flow values.
#'
#' @param a is a data set to pivot from. 
#' @param b is "year" as a column that identifies each observation. 
#' @param c is "extreme_type" as a column to get the names from 
#' @param d is "flow" as a column to get the cell values from. 
#' @return wrapper is a pivoted table including year, maximum and minimum flow values. 

Pivot_func <- function(a, b, c, d) {
  wrapper <- a%>% pivot_wider(id_cols = b, names_from = c, values_from = d)
  return(wrapper)
}
```

```{r}
Pivot_func(a = flow_sample, b = "year", c = "extreme_type", d = "flow")
```


I will define a function "annual_flow_gap" as the difference between annual maximum flow and minimum flow.
```{r}
#' This function is to find a delta value, which is the difference
#' between the annual maximum flow and minimum flow. 
#'
#' @param data is a data set to use. 
#' @param x is the maximum flow value. 
#' @param y is the minimum flow value. 
#' @return "flow_gap" creates the table of outputs that are the difference between maximum and minimum flows for each year. 

annual_flow_gap <- function (data, x, y, na.rm = TRUE) {
  data %>%
    summarise(flow_gap = x - y) 
    return(flow_gap)
}
```


```{r}
#notes from class 
annual_flow_gap <- function (data, x, y, na.rm = TRUE) {
  calculations <- dplyr::summarise(data,
                                   is_numeric_x = is.numeric({{x}}),
                                   class_x = class({{x}}),
                                    is_numeric_y = is.numeric({{y}}),
                                   class_y = class({{y}}))
  print(calculations)
  if(!calculations$is_numeric_y && calculations$is_numeric_x) {
    stop("Selected column is not numeric. Class of x is: ", 
         calculations$class_x, 
         "Class of y is: ",
         calculations$class_y)
  }
    summarise(flow_gap = x - y) 
    return(flow_gap)
}
```
Finally, the function below plots the graph of the annual differences between maximum and minimum flows. 
```{r}
#' This function is to plot a graph of 
#' annual differences between the maximum and minimum flow values. 
#'
#' @param df is a data set to use. 
#' @param year is the year cell value. 
#' @param delta is the difference between maximum and minimum flows. 
#' @return output is the graph with x-axis as year and y-axis as the delta values. 

plot_annual_flow_gap <- function (df, year, delta, na.rm = TRUE) {
  df %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = delta)) +
    geom_line()
}
```
